# Obtaining the datasets

The example notebooks operate on a set of spatial omics datasets that can be downloaded and converted to Zarr (OME-NGFF) with the scripts available in https://github.com/giovp/spatialdata-sandbox.

Here you can find the dataset hosted in S3 object storage.

Note: opening the above URLs in a web browser would not work, you need to treat the URLs as Zarr stores. For example if you append `.zgroup` to any of the URLs above you will be able to see that file.
